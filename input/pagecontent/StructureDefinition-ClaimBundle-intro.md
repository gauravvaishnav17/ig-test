The profile is based on a Bundle of type collection, where all the supporting information required for processing claim can be shared. Multiple entries can be added in a bundle to provide information like financial, clinical, provision of health care services with payors and for reporting to regulatory bodies and firms which provide data analytics. The bundle can be generated depending on the nature of the request defined by 'use' element in a [Claim] resource, like preauthorization, predetermination and claim and can be shared over NHCX ecosystem.
