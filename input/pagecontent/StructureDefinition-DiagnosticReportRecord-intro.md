This profile sets minimum expectations for the DiagnosticReportRecord that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation to a Diagnostic Report of a patient. It identifies the mandatory core elements, vocabularies and value sets which SHALL be present in the Composition resource when using this profile.

The resources capturing the measurements, tests, panels, observations, interpretation, etc. in Diagnostics domain can use LOINC codes. The guide for using the LOINC codes in the FHIR resources can be found [here.](https://nrces.in/download/files/pdf/Guide%20for%20using%20LOINC%20in%20ABDM%20FHIR%20Resources.pdf)
